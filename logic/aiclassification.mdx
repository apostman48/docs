## Overview

Our AI-powered property photo classification feature automatically identifies and categorizes real estate listing photos, making it easier for users to browse and organize property images. This technology analyzes photos and assigns them classifications like "Kitchen," "Bathroom," "Living Room," and more.

The classification system uses machine learning to analyze property photos and predict what room or area each image shows. Each classification includes:

* **Room/Area Type**: The predicted classification (e.g., "Kitchen", "Bedroom")
* **Confidence Score**: A prediction value between 0 and 1 indicating how confident the AI is in its classification

## API Integration

Classifications are included in the `imageInsights` object within your API response. Here's the structure:

```
"images": [
    {
        "image": "IMG-C12134349_13.jpg",
        "classification": {
            "imageOf": "Kitchen",
            "prediction": 0.9993257523
        }
    },
    {
        "image": "IMG-C12134349_22.jpg",
        "classification": {
            "imageOf": "Bedroom",
            "prediction": 0.964843154
        }
    }
]
```
