## Overview

If you're receiving a **403 Forbidden** error when trying to access RESTimates (AI-Powered Property Estimates), this indicates that the RESTimates addon is not included in your current plan or has not been activated for your account.

## Understanding the Error

The 403 error occurs because:

* **RESTimates is not included by default** in plans
* The addon requires a separate upgrade and activation
* Your account lacks the necessary permissions to access the estimation endpoint

## Requirements for RESTimates

To use RESTimates successfully, you need:

### 1. Plan Upgrade

RESTimates requires a specific addon that must be purchased and activated separately from your base plan.

### 2. MLS速 Compatibility

**Important**: RESTimates functionality is subject to MLS速 restrictions. Some MLS速 Systems do not permit AI-powered property estimates, which means this feature may not be available in certain markets regardless of your plan level.

### 3. VOW Feed Required

RESTimates requires access to a **VOW (Virtual Office Website) feed**. This feature is not possible with certain IDX feeds that have limited data scope, as they don't provide the comprehensive property data necessary for accurate AI-powered estimates.
